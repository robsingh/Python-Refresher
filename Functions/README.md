# Introduction

It is a fundamental concept in programming. In the most general sense, a function is a structuring element in programming languages to group a bunch of statements so they can be utilized in a program more than once.

Functions are known under various names in programming languages, for example, as subroutines, routines, procedures, methods, or subprograms.

# Functions in Python

A function in Python starts with a 'def' keyword. The general syntax looks like this:

```
def function_name(parameters):
    statements (the function body)
```

The parameters consists of none or more parameters. Parameters are called 'Arguments', if the function is called. The function body consists of indented statements. The function body gets executed every time the function is called.
