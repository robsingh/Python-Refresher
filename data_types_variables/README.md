# My experience
I have programmed in low-level programming languages such as C, C++ and when I started with Python, I realized that I already know enough about **Data Types and Variables**, but I was **wrong**. 
There is a difference in how Python and C deal with variables. There are integers, floating point numbers, strings and many more, but things are not the same as in C or C++. 

For example, if you have to use lists or associative arrays in C, you will have to construct the data type list or associative arrays from scratch! i.e. design memory structure and the allocation management. You will have to implement necessary search and access methods as well. We are going to read about it next. 

# Variables in Python
There is no declaration of variables required in Python, which makes it quite easy. If there is a need for a variable, you think of a descriptive name and start using it! 

Fun fact: Not only the value of a variable may change during program execution, but the type as well. You can assign an integer value to a variable, use it as a integer for a while and later assign a string to the same variable. 

Python variables are references to objects, but the actual data is contained in the objects.
