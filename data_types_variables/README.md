# My experience
I have programmed in low-level programming languages such as C, C++ and when I started with Python, I realized that I already know enough about **Data Types and Variables**, but I was **wrong**. 
There is a difference in how Python and C deal with variables. There are integers, floating point numbers, strings and many more, but things are not the same as in C or C++. 

For example, if you have to use lists or associative arrays in C, you will have to construct the data type list or associative arrays from scratch! i.e. design memory structure and the allocation management.
