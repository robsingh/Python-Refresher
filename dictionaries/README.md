# Introduction - Dictionary

A dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. 

For example, 
```
person = {
    'name': 'Deve',
    'age': 28,
    'city': 'Poland',
    'email': 'deve@example.com'
}
```
* Keys in the above example are 'name', 'age', 'city', and 'email'. 
* Every key has a corresponding value.
* We call a key-value pair an item. 
* Dictionaries are useful for organizing data in a way that allows quick and easy access. 
* Dictionaries are mutable.  


# Dictionary and Lists

A list is a sequence of objects where the order matters. You can access the elements of the list through its index. Similarly dictionaries are also ordered but we can't access elements by their position.
