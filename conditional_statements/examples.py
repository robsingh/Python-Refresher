Write a Python program that checks the temperature and provides a message based on the 
temperature value. 

If the temperature is above 27 degrees Celsius, it should print "It's a hot day." 
If the temperature is 27 degrees or below, it should print "It's not a hot day."

temperature = int(input("Enter the temperature: "))

if temperature > 27:

    print("it's not a hot day")
